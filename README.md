Search for any item across all of the Sale sections of Craigslis, and compile their price, description, and URL into a CSV.

Once downloaded, run the cmd 'scrapy runspider datamine.py -o results.csv' in the directory of your code. This will kick off the program (Note: To change the name of the CSV, simply replace results.csv with your choice of file name).
